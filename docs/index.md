# <provider> Delphix Provider

!> **NOTE**
The Terraform Provider for Delphix requires the Delphix Continuous Data Platform and Data Control Tower (DCT).


The Terraform Provider for Delphix enables customers to manage data-as-code alongside their infrastructure.
With Terraform and Delphix, customers can now automatically provision, manage, and teardown ephemeral data environments to drive enterprise DevOps workflows enabling test data management.

This provider leverages REST APIs available through the Delphix Data Control Tower (DCT). Before use, configure the Provider using an API key generated by DCT and registering Delphix engines within DCT.

To learn more about the Terraform Provider, webinar events, and other Delphix solutions, see our [Delphix Website](https://www.delphix.com/solutions/terraform). If you need technical guidance around Delphix and DCT, refer to the [Delphix Documentation](https://docs.delphix.com) and [DCT Documentation](https://docs.delphix.com/dct) websites.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    delphix = {
      source = "delphix-integrations/delphix"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the DXI Provider
provider "delphix" {
  tls_insecure_skip = true
  key = "dct_api_key"
  host = "dct_hostname"
}

# Provision a VDB
resource "delphix_vdb" "vdb_name" {
  auto_select_repository = true
  source_data_id         = "DATASOURCE_ID"
}
```

## Configuration and API Key Generation

Delphix Provider uses DCT APIs to communicate with the Delphix engines. Authentication to DCT APIs are handled using API Keys.
For generation of the API key, please refer to [Authentication](https://docs.delphix.com/dct/authentication-170164311.html).


## Argument Reference

* __key__ : The API key is provided in this field that gets passed on to DCT for authentication.
* __host__: The host name for where DCT APIGW is running.
* __tls_insecure_skip__: This takes a boolean value which determines whether to skip the TLS check. tls_insecure_skip is really unsafe to set it to true. By default it is `false`.
* __host_scheme__: Determines the host scheme configured. By default it is `https`.
