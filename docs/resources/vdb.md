# Resource: <resource name> delphix_vdb

In Delphix terminology, a VDB is a database provisioned from either a dSource or another VDB which is a full read/write copy of the source data. 
A VDB is created and managed by the Delphix Continuous Data Engine.


The VDB resource allows terraform to CREATE (also known as Provision), READ, UPDATE and DELETE Delphix Virtual Databases (VDB). 
Update operation does not support all VDB parameters. The supported parameters are listed below.

## Example Usage
Provisioning can be done in 2 methods, provision by snapshot and provision by timestamp.

```hcl
# Provision a VDB using latest snapshot.

resource "delphix_vdb" "vdb_name" {
  auto_select_repository = true
  source_data_id         = "DATASOURCE_ID"
}

# Provision a VDB using timestamp and post refresh hooks

resource "delphix_vdb" "vdb_name2" {
  provision_type         = "timestamp"
  auto_select_repository = true
  source_data_id         = "DATASOURCE_ID"
  timestamp              = "2021-05-01T08:51:34.148000+00:00"

  post_refresh {
    name    = "HOOK_NAME"
    command = "COMMAND"
  }
}

# Provision a VDB from a bookmark with a single VDB

resource "delphix_vdb" "test_vdb" {
  provision_type         = "bookmark"
  auto_select_repository = true
  bookmark_id            = "BOOKMARK_ID"
  environment_id         = "ENV_ID"
}

# Provision a VDB using snapshot and pre refresh hooks

resource "delphix_vdb" "vdb_name" {
  provision_type         = "snapshot"
  auto_select_repository = true
  source_data_id         = "DATASOURCE_ID"

  pre_refresh {
    name    = "HOOK_NAME"
    command = "COMMAND"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `source_data_id` - (Optional) The ID or name of the source object (dSource or VDB) to provision from. All other objects referenced by the parameters must live on the same engine as the source.

* `engine_id` - (Optional) The ID or name of the Engine onto which to provision. If the source ID unambiguously identifies a source object, this parameter is unnecessary and ignored.

* `target_group_id` - (Optional) The ID of the group into which the VDB will be provisioned. If unset, a group is selected randomly on the Engine.

* `vdb_name` - (Optional) The unique name of the provisioned VDB within a group. If unset, a name is randomly generated.

* `database_name` - (Optional) The name of the database on the target environment. Defaults to vdb_name.

* `cdb_id` - (Optional) The ID of the container database (CDB) to provision an Oracle Multitenant database into. When this is not set, a new vCDB will be provisioned.

* `cluster_node_ids` - (Optional) The cluster node ids, name or addresses for this provision operation (Oracle RAC Only).

* `truncate_log_on_checkpoint` - (Optional) Whether to truncate log on checkpoint (ASE only).
