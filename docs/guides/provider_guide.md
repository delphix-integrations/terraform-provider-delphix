## Delphix Provider Guide
[We have provided a handful of examples in our GitHub repository to help you get a jump start with our Delphix Provider.](https://github.com/delphix-integrations/terraform-provider-delphix/tree/main/examples) These examples range from Terraform resource templates, quick Terraform examples, and full Jenkins pipelines. We update this repository based on our implementation experience, so be sure to check back for updates!
If you have a suggested template, request, or modification, please submit it in our [GitHub Issues section.](https://github.com/delphix-integrations/terraform-provider-delphix)
