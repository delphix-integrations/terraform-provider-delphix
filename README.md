Terraform Provider for Delphix enables Terraform to create and manage Delphix Continuous Data &
Continuous Compliance infrastructure using the Delphix Control Tower (DCT) APIs.

Full implementation directions can be found on the [Delphix Ecosystem Documentation](https://ecosystem.delphix.com/docs/overview-3) and [Terraform Provider Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/delphix-integrations/delphix/latest/docs).

## Prerequisites

1. Install Delphix Control Tower (DCT). For more information, visit the [DCT documentation](https://docs.delphix.com/dct).
2. Delphix Continuous Data and Continuous Compliance engines must be connected to DCT.
3. An API key must be created for authenticating with DCT APIs. Refer to the [DCT API keys documentation](https://dct.delphix.com/docs/api-keys-2) for more info.
4. Additional infrastructure required for testing the provider operations. [e.g Hosts to be added as environments, dSources to create VDBs from]
5. Development setup for Golang.
